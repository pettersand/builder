## Architecture
A detailed description of the system's architecture will be available in the [Frontend](Frontend.md), [Backend](Backend.md), and [Data Handling](DataHandling.md) documentation.

## Documentation
The documentation is structured to provide a comprehensive guide to the Builder app:
- [Frontend Guide](Frontend.md): Insights into the Svelte and TypeScript-based frontend.
- [Backend Guide](Backend.md): Details on the Django and PostgreSQL backend.
- [Data Handling](DataHandling.md): An overview of data management within the app.

## Global Principles
Our development is guided by the principles of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and modular design, ensuring that our codebase is efficient and maintainable.

## Getting Started
For now, Builder is in active development, and contribution guidelines will be provided as the project opens for collaboration.

## Conclusion

Builder is more than just a fitness app; it's a data-driven ecosystem that empowers fitness professionals and enthusiasts to achieve their goals with precision and analytical depth.
