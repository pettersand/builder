# Backend Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the backend architecture, configurations, and practices for the program builder project using Django.

## Database
- **Choice of Database**: PostgreSQL for its ease of use and cost-effectiveness.
- **Migrations**: Managed iteratively with plans for robust migration handling in the future.

## Architecture
- **Structure**: The backend is organized into a modular API chain with individual files for models, views, and serializers within the `builder` directory.
- **CRUD Operations**: Clearly defined rules for CRUD operations and serializer usage are in development.

## Authentication and Authorization
- **Current State**: Basic implementation with plans for a comprehensive overhaul to ensure robust security and permissions handling.

## Application Setup
- **Builder App Role**: The `builder` directory contains models, views, serializers, and tests. A redundant `programbuilder` directory exists from the project's inception.

## Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) and CSRF
- **Configuration**: Basic CORS and CSRF settings are configured within `settings.py` with further refinements planned for different deployment environments.

## Third-Party Django Apps
- **Usage**: Currently under evaluation for specific functionalities they might provide.

## Static and Media Files
- **Handling**: Limited use of static or media files, with external hosting planned for video content.

## API Endpoints
- **Flow**: Endpoints are defined in `urls.py` and linked to respective views and serializers, maintaining a clear and modular approach.

## Critical Settings
- **Performance and Security**: Continuous evaluation of Django settings to optimize application performance and maintain security standards.
- **Environment Variables**: Managed via .env files and GitHub secrets, ensuring sensitive information is kept secure.

## Testing
- **Current Practices**: Utilizing Django's testing framework with intentions to enhance test coverage and robustness.

## Continuous Integration and Deployment
- **GitHub Actions**: Employed for CI with plans to incorporate full CI/CD pipelines including Docker containerization and deployment strategies.

## Documentation
- **Code Comments**: Aiming for efficient comments that elucidate the impact of changes, potential breakages, and their ripple effects throughout the application.

## Scalability and Performance
- **Future Plans**: Detailed strategies for scaling the application and optimizing performance will be established, including but not limited to database indexing, query optimization, and efficient data handling.

## Accessibility and Compliance
- **GDPR and Other Regulations**: Commitment to adhere to GDPR and other relevant regulations, with detailed implementation to be outlined in the future.

## Accessibility and Language Support
- **To Be Defined**: Plans for accessibility features and internationalization support will be refined and implemented as the project progresses.

## Conclusion
The backend architecture is built with a focus on modularity, security, and future scalability. While several aspects are still under development, the foundational structure is in place to support robust data management and application functionality.
