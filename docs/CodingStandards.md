# Coding Standards

## Overview

This document outlines the coding standards for the project. It aims to maintain code quality, consistency, and readability.

## Code Formatting and Style

- **Formatter**: We use Prettier for automatic code formatting.
- **Indentation**: Follows Prettier defaults.
- **Line Length**: Managed by Prettier.

## Naming Conventions

- **General Approach**: Descriptive names are preferred for readability. Variable names should not exceed three words unless necessary.
- **TypeScript**: Use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes and interfaces.
- **Python (Backend)**: Follow snake_case naming convention.

## Commenting and Documentation

- **General Approach**: Strive for detailed comments in files, including file descriptions and potential impact of changes.
- **Inline Comments**: Focus on clarity and efficiency, avoiding redundancy.
- **Docstrings**: To be implemented.

## Version Control Practices

- **General Approach**: Currently a solo project, standard Git practices are followed without specific branching strategies.
- **Commit Messages**: Short and concise.

## Testing and Quality Assurance

- **Frameworks**: Jest for TypeScript, Django's built-in testing for the backend. Additional framework for Svelte testing to be determined.
- **Testing Strategy**: Basic testing implemented, with plans for comprehensive testing pre-launch.

## Error Handling and Security

- **General Approach**: Focus on validation, error handling, and security practices to be refined in the upcoming refactor.
- **Security**: Adherence to security principles and GDPR compliance is crucial.

## Performance and Optimization

- **General Approach**: Emphasis on modular code, reusability, and efficiency. Specific optimization strategies to be outlined later.

## Accessibility and Internationalization

- **Plans for Implementation**: To be defined in the upcoming refactor.

## Additional Topics

- **Branching Strategy**: To be defined.
- **Commit Message Standards**: To be defined.
- **Pull Request and Code Review Process**: To be defined.
- **Code Coverage and Quality Metrics**: To be defined.
- **Logging Standards**: To be defined.
- **Internationalization and Localization Practices**: To be defined.
